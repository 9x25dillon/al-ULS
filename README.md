# TA ULS Julia Integration Server

A high-performance Julia-based microservice providing advanced matrix optimization, stability analysis, and entropy regularization inspired by **TA ULS (Topology-Aware Uncertainty Learning Systems)**. Designed for integration with Python workflows or AI systems requiring symbolic or statistical matrix optimization.

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **Matrix Optimization** using:
  - Kinetic Force Principles (`kfp`)
  - Entropy Regularization (`entropy`)
  - SVD-based Stability Regularization (`stability`)
  - Enhanced Sparsity (`sparsity`)
  - Low-Rank Approximation (`rank`)
  - Auto-mode: Chooses best method dynamically
- 📊 **Stability Analysis**: Eigenvalue spread, spectral radius, condition number
- 📉 **Entropy Tracking**: Quantifies and adjusts informational complexity of weight matrices
- 🌐 **HTTP Server Mode**: Exposes functionality via JSON API
